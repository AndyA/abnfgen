This is abnfgen, an ABNF-grammar based test case generator.

ABNF -- Advanced Backus Naur Form -- is a grammar format used in
many protocol specifications.  It is described in RFC 4234.
ABNF looks like this:
	
	coin = "heads" / "tails"    ; one of two outcomes

Given an ABNF grammar, abnfgen generates files in a subdirectory.
Each file is a (different) random document that complies with
the grammar.

Uses:
  o With -l, checking an ABNF grammar for syntactical correctness.

  o Generating sample documents that illustrate a grammar -
    "Is this what you meant?"

  o Generating test cases for tools that are supposed
    to parse the grammar.
